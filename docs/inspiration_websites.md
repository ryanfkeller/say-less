# Overall Takeaways:
1. Where possible, use multi-color styling while still being easy on the eyes. Consider using this for splash sections while having main content in "black and white"
2. Typography selection is important
3. Use off-white and dark greys for blank space and text
4. Bold statement with color splash at top of page, scroll down for more content
5. Menu bar can have links to sections in the page, selecting them scrolls you to the right place
6. Graphics and colors rather than pictures
7. Visual tone is polished but friendly. (Font choice helps with professional, color helps with friendly)
