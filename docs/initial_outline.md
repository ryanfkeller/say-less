## How It Works

### A Thoughtful, Collaborative Process Tailored to You

- **Step 1: Intake & Discovery**  
  We start with a conversation to understand your goals and the opportunity you’re pursuing.

- **Step 2: Deep Dive & Analysis**  
  I review your draft and any supporting materials, asking thoughtful questions to uncover your strongest narrative.

- **Step 3: Strategic Rewrite**  
  I reconstruct your application or statement into a clear, concise, and persuasive story — weaving rhetoric and meaning throughout.

- **Step 4: Review & Refinement**  
  We collaborate on feedback and final tweaks, ensuring your story truly reflects your unique strengths.

> _Note: Because this work demands focus and care, I take on only one project at a time — ensuring you get my full attention and expertise._
